Supported options
=================

The recipe supports any number of options, which are Python functions. 
Since the ini parser used with buildout doesn't preserve initial whitespace each line of your method should start
with a `...` followed by the whitespace as per normal python.
They will look like this ::

  [myscripts]
  recipe = mr.scripty
  MAX = 10
  function1 =
    ... x = range(1,int(self.MAX))
    ... return ' '.join(x)


The return value will be stored as a value in the buildout parts options which is available for
replacement in other buildout parts. What is returned is always converted to a string.

As each option is a Python function, it needs to possess an acceptable function identifier (see
http://docs.python.org/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-identifier). For instance,
typical buildout options with hyphens (such as `environment-vars`) will be invalid.

Options all in upper case are treated as string constants and added to the Recipe instance
as an attribute.

These functions are actually instance methods of the instance of the scripty recipe.
Methods are evaluated during the initialization of the Recipe instance, i.e.
after the cfg is read but before any `install` or 'update` recipe methods have been called.
Method names of `install`, `update` are treated specially and not evaluated during
initialization but rather during the install and update phases of building this
recipe instance.
These can be used as quick in-place replacement for creating a real recipe and have the same
semantics as detailed in http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout#id3. In addition any option beginning
with `_` is not evaluated so can be used as a private method. Since these are methods `self` is
an available local variable which refers to the recipe instance. `self.options`, `self.buildout` and
`self.name` are also available.

Example usage
=============

Tranforming Varnish backends for HAProxy
----------------------------------------

Let's say you want to transform the a varnish:backends value to what can
be used inside haproxy::

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = scripty echobackends echorepeat
    ...
    ... [varnish]
    ... backends =
    ... 	myhost.com:255.255.255.1
    ...     myhost2.com:125.125.125.1
    ...
    ... [scripty]
    ... recipe = mr.scripty
    ... backends =
    ...   ... res = ""
    ...   ... for line in self.buildout['varnish']['backends'].splitlines():
    ...   ...    if ':' not in line:
    ...   ...      continue
    ...   ...    host,dest = line.split(':')
    ...   ...    host = host.split('.')[0]
    ...   ...    res += "acl %s url_sub VirtualHostRoot/%s\\n" % (dest,host)
    ...   ... return res
    ... repeat =
    ...   ... opt_repeatx = int(self.options['repeatx'])
    ...   ... fun_repeatx = self.repeatx()
    ...   ... return '\\n'.join(["this is line %s"%i for i in range(1,opt_repeatx+1)])
    ... repeatx = return '10'
    ...
    ... [echobackends]
    ... recipe = mr.scripty
    ... install = print self.buildout['scripty']['backends']; return []
    ...
    ... [echorepeat]
    ... recipe = mr.scripty
    ... install =
    ...   ... script = self.buildout['scripty']
    ...   ... print script['repeat']
    ...   ... return []
    ... """)

Running the buildout gives us::

    >>> print 'start', system(buildout) 
    start...
    Installing echobackends.
    acl host url_sub VirtualHostRoot/255.255.255.1
    acl host2 url_sub VirtualHostRoot/125.125.125.1
    <BLANKLINE>
    Installing echorepeat.
    this is line 1
    this is line 2
    this is line 3
    this is line 4
    this is line 5
    this is line 6
    this is line 7
    this is line 8
    this is line 9
    this is line 10
    <BLANKLINE>

From this example you'll notice several things. Options that are part of a mr.scripty part are
turned into methods of the part instance and can call each other. In addition, each method can
be called from other buildout recipes by accessing the option via ${part:method} or in code via
self.buildout[part][method].

Offsetting port numbers
-----------------------

The following example will make all the values of ports_base available with an offset added to
each one ::

    [ports_base]
    instance1=8101
    instance2=8102


    [ports]
    recipe=mr.scripty
    OFFSET = 1000
    init=
      ... for key,value in self.buildout['ports_base'].items():
      ...   self.options[key] = str(int(value)+int(self.OFFSET))

Different download links for certain architectures
--------------------------------------------------

This example usage shows how to alter download links for third-party libraries
based upon whether the host platform is 32 or 64-bit. Note that the example
uses Python 2.6 or later::

    [buildout]
    parts =
        ...
        download

    [scripty]
    recipe = mr.scripty
    DOWNLOAD_URL_64 = http://site.com/64bit.tgz
    DOWNLOAD_URL_32 = http://site.com/32bit.tgz
    download_url =
    ... import platform
    ... is_64bit = any(['64' in x for x in platform.architecture()])
    ... return is_64bit and self.DOWNLOAD_URL_64 or self.DOWNLOAD_URL_32

    [download]
    recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download
    url = ${scripty:download_url}

Checking existence of directories
---------------------------------

This example tests the existence of a list of directories and selects
the first one that can be found on the system.  In this particular example,
we look through a list of potential JDK directories, as the location will
differ across Linux distributions, in order to install an egg that depends
on having a Java SDK install available::
     
    [buildout]
    parts =
        ...
        jpype

    [scripty]
    recipe = mr.scripty
    JAVA_PATHS = 
        /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk
        /etc/alternatives/java_sdk
        ${buildout:directory}
    java = 
        ... import os
        ... paths = self.JAVA_PATHS.split('\n')
        ... exists = [os.path.exists(path) for path in paths]
        ... return paths[exists.index(True)]

    [java-env]
    JAVA_HOME = ${scripty:java}

    [jpype]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg:custom
    egg = JPype
    find-links =
        http://aarnet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/jpype/JPype/0.5.4/JPype-0.5.4.1.zip
    environment = java-env
